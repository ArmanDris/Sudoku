1. Set up a backend server: 
You'll need to create a server-side application using a backend programming language like Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc. This application will handle incoming requests from your game and store the scores in a database.

2. Create an API endpoint: 
Within your backend application, define an API endpoint (e.g., /scores) that will receive the score data from your game. This endpoint should expect a POST request with the score information in the request body.

3. Send data from the game to the backend: 
In your game's JavaScript code, you can use the fetch() function (or other AJAX methods) to send a POST request to the API endpoint you created. Include the score data in the request body as JSON.

4. Handle the request in the backend: 
In your backend application, define the logic to handle the incoming POST request to the /scores endpoint. Extract the score data from the request body and store it in your chosen database. You may need to install and use a database library or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

5. Store the scores: 
Determine how you want to store the scores in your database. You could create a table or collection to hold the scores, and each entry should include details like the user's name, score, and any additional information you want to track.

6. Retrieve scores if needed: 
If you plan to display high scores or leaderboards, you'll need to create additional API endpoints to fetch and retrieve the scores from your backend. This can be done by defining routes that retrieve the data from the database and return it as a response to the client.


To start this server run: python3 server.py
